        <h1>Exercise: Block vs. Inline Elements</h1>
        <p class="note">Some basic styling has been applied in order to illustrate the elements structure and
            boundaries.</p>

        <h2>Task 1: Swap Block and Inline Elements</h2>
        <span>In the HTML of this document, change this div element to a span element.</span>

        <p class="question">What happens to the layout? Does it still take up the full width? A: When the
        <div> is changed to a <span>, the text no longer takes up the full width. It only occupies the space needed for
                the content, staying within the flow of the text.</p>

                <h2>Task 2: Nesting Inline in Block</h2>
                <p>A paragraph <span>&lt;span&gt; element;</span> and an <em>emphasized</em> word.</p>
                <p class="question">Add another inline element like &lt;em&gt; or &lt;strong&gt; inside the paragraph.
                    Observe
                    how it flows within the line. A:By adding an inline element like <em> inside the paragraph, the text
                        stays on the same line within the block. Inline elements are placed next to each other, and the
                        flow of the paragraph is not interrupted.</p>

                <h2>Task3: Nesting Block in Inline</h2>
                <span>
                    Try placing a <div>block inside span</div>
                </span>

                <p class="question">What error or layout issue do you see? Why does this happen? A:You cannot place a
                <div> (block) inside a <span> (inline) because block elements must occupy the full width and cannot be
                        inside an inline element. The browser corrects this by moving the block outside of the inline,
                        causing a layout change.</p>


                        <h2>Task 4: Review the HTML markup of the following Inline Elements</h2>
                        &lt;img&gt; element
                        <img src="images/castle.webp" alt="placeholder image (images are inline)" width="300"
                            height="300">
                        <a href="https://churchofjesuschrist.org">&lt;a&gt; anchor element</a>
                        <button type="button">&lt;button&gt; element</button>
